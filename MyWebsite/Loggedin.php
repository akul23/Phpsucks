        <h2>WELCOME</h2>
            <p><b>Thanks for visiting and logging in my website</b><br>
            Your password and username will be remembered <br>
            if by any cahnce you lose your password. <b>Please contact me</b><br>
            My contacts are on the contact page.<br>
            I do apologize for not making a forgotten password sytem,<br>
            but the <b>website is still in a developing state...</b>
        </p>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p><b>Whats this site for? I got no clue!</b><br>
            This is the home page, not alot to it but you can go to other pages...<br>
            this sucks took me 3 damn days to make this and im only at the home page. </p>
        <h2>Plans</h2>
        <p>Here are my future plans with this website<br>
        Well first i gotta make all the left pages<br>
        but lets put that aside for now<br>
        I will make a slovenian version of this website<br>
        because why not. Forgotten password system would suit well<br>
        I will also add profile pictures to costumize your account abit.<br>
        Please keep track of this paragraph since it will be changing alot.

        </p>
